This project regarding agriculture technology.
We build agriculture technology to solve humanity’s most fundamental challenge: “How to feed the world”.
We use machine learning to solve the biggest challenges in agriculture.
Why is it that neighboring fields, with identical growing conditions, can produce such drastically different yields? 
This was the question that drove us to establish Prospera, and it’s what still drives us today.
Using our data science and machine learning background, we explored ways to bring more certainty to an unpredictable industry. 
As the current agricultural revolution unfolds, digitalization will become the crop production engine to meet rising population demands and ensure environmental sustainability.
Taking a ground-up approach, our technology enables growers to make more informed, efficient, and scientific decisions. 
We make agriculture predictable and optimizable across the entire growth cycle. 
Our technology advances agricultural productivity by helping growers do more with fewer resources.
